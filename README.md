# Supplementary data

The numbers underlying each of the figures in "Periodic synchronization of
dengue epidemics in Thailand between 1968 and 2018: the roles played by
temperature and immunity" and its Supplementary information are grouped into
several zip files.

Some multi-panel figures contain different types of data; these may be
provided in separate files. Data for some multi-panel figures may be too large
for a single file and may be split up into separate files.
